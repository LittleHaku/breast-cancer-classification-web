  <h3>Hyperparameters</h3>
  <p>Hyperparameters are the parameters that are not learned by the model, they are set before the training process, to
    optimize the model, you can change these parameters to see how the model behaves.</p>

  <h3>Metrics</h3>
  <p>Metrics let us see how well the model is performing, the confusion matrix shows us how many samples were classified
    correctly and how many were classified incorrectly.</p>

      <strong>Balanced Accuracy:</strong> {{ metric.balanced_accuracy }}<br>

  <h3>Feature Importance</h3>
  <details>
    <summary>Click here to see global features importance</summary>
    <p>In both plots the features are ranked by importance, with the most important feature at the top.</p>
    <p>The second one, the beeswarm plot, shows the distribution of feature importance for each feature, each dot
      represents a sample, the color represents if the value was high or low, and then if it is to the left or right of
      the mean indicates how important that feature was for the decision, the more to the right the more malignant the
      sample was, and the more to the left the more benign it was.</p>
    <div class="plots">
      <div>
        <h4>Bar Plot</h4>
        <img src="{% static metric.global_features_plot %}" alt="Global Features Plot"
          style="max-width: 800px; height: auto;">

<h3>Single Feature Analysis</h3>
<p>In these plots we can see in more detail how each of the features affects the result, each dot is again a sample, with dots to the right being higher values of that feature, and dots to the left being lower values of that feature, the Y axis is the predicted probability of the sample being malignant, the more to the top the more malignant the sample was, and the more to the bottom the more benign it was. The red line helps us see the trend of the feature, if the line is going up, it means that the feature is positively correlated with the result, that is, the higher the value, the more likely the sample is to be malignant, and if the line is going down, it means that the feature is negatively correlated with the result. Lastly the color of the dots are related to another feature which is selected by the SHAP library, the more pink the higher that feature, the more blue the lower that feature.</p>
